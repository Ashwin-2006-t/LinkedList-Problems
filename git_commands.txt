cd path/to/your/project

cd stands for change directory.
Navigate to the folder where your code files are stored.


git init

This creates a new Git repository in your folder.
It adds a hidden .git folder where Git stores all version history.


git add .

This stages all your files (prepares them for commit).
The . means "add everything in this folder".

You can also add specific files like:   git add file1.java file2.java


git commit -m "Initial commit - Added Linked List problems"

This saves a snapshot of your code.
-m lets you add a commit message describing what you did.



git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

Connects your local Git repo to GitHub.
Replace the URL with your actual GitHub repo link.


git branch -M main

Renames the default branch to main (GitHub uses main by default).
Do this if your current branch is named master.


git push -u origin main

Sends your local commits to GitHub.
origin is the remote GitHub repo.
main is the branch youâ€™re pushing to.
-u sets upstream tracking so you can later just use git push.


After this, to push future updates:

git add .
git commit -m "Your new message"
git push
